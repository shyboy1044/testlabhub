                                    agreements between the parties.

                                <div>9. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Contract will be held to be invalid or
                                    unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable.
                                    If a court finds that any provision of this Contract is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting
                                    such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision will be deemed to be
                                    written, construed, and enforced as so limited.

                                    signed by the party obligated under the amendment.

                                <div>13. WAIVER OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHT. The failure of either party to enforce any
                                    provision of this Contract shall not be construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's right to
                                    subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Contract.
