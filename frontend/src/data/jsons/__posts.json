        "desc": "If you have heard about the risk of mobile phone radiation causing cancer, then appreciate RF exposure phenomena. While cancer risk from mobile phones is yet to be definitively proven, the current position by regulatory and industry participants is one of encouraging minimized exposure as much as possible. The health and safety concern is not limited to mobile phones, but extends to other devices that intentionally radiate radio energy and may come in close proximity to persons either in a workplace or public environment, such as retail Electronic Article Surveillance equipment.Microwave ovens are an obvious example of how radio energy from radiation heats up food items placed in them, where energy transfer from the radiation results in heating of the food items. Nonetheless, ionizing radiation from X-Rays with electrons split from atoms and molecules is known to carry far more significant health risks than non-ionizing radiation from radio energy, due to higher energy levels transmitted.",
